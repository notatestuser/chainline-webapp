**Get anything anywhere, powered by the blockchain.** Chain Line is a peer-to-peer shipping network that gets products and valuable items to their destinations with near-zero risk.

It works by moving an item's cost between peers as it travels through the system. A central "hub" contract controls "reserved funds" in Chain Line [smart wallets](https://github.com/notatestuser/chainline-contracts-kt/wiki/Smart-Wallet) running custom verification scripts. Chain Line features a user reputation system and relies on no external systems, operating entirely on the blockchain.
